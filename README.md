# etyl-gdx-base-backend
Base gdx backend to etyl

This repository contains hacks to fool maven and gradle so etyl can run in Desktop or Android with the same code.

Do not include it in your project (unless you are developing a new backend or library to etyl-gdx),
this library should be used by etyl-gdx libraries only.
